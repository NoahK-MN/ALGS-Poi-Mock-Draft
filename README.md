This a project which is meant to be used in order to create mock poi drafts for Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) Tournaments. 
Basic information for ALGS can be found here https://liquipedia.net/apexlegends/Apex_Legends_Global_Series/2024/Split_2/Pro_League/North_America .
The homepage of the project specifies how the user can make, save, and view saved mock drafts as shown below.

This project incorporates a very basic account system where a user can create or login into an account of a unique username. 
The backend of the app is very primitive as the account information isn't encrypted and the data sent via http requests isn't validated on the backend. 

Below is a preview of a draft page of the project, in this example 2 Poi's (Command Center and Lava Fissure) have been drafted.

After a user logs in and creates a mock draft they can then save it.
